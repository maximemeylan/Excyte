\arguments{
\item{processed_fcs_obj}{list containing a datraframe of processed intensities for each event and informations of channel used}

\item{channels}{vector containing channels to select. Can be "all" to select all channels, "with_desc" to select channels with a marker description or a vector a channels.}

\item{k}{numeric indicating the number of neighbor for phenograph and umap computation}

\item{downsampling_umap}{numeric indicating the number of events to select to compute the umap}
}
